# vb-bagis-p

BAGIS-P is Basin Analysis GIS Parameters. It is used to generate parameters to feed the USGS PRMS run-off model. 

BAGIS-P is written using VB .NET on the .NET 4.5 framework. BAGIS-P is delivered to users as an ESRI ArcMap add-in and is compatible with ArcMap 10.5 or higher. Users define a set of HRU's in BAGIS-H before using BAGIS-P to generate parameters.
